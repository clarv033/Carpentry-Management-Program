# Carpentry-Management-Program
This is the draft of the program ive been creating for my A-Level AQA Computer science NEA, I have moved the bulk of what I have made in the past few weeks onto github so I can better manage updating things.

TBD:
- Read-only column elements (cant edit the objects in the gui visually)
- Filter by column (ascending, descending)
- Customer tab: ID needs to use lowest number possible (e.g. if id 4 is deleted it should start at 3 or the lowest)
- Customer tab: Phone & Email error handler (number digits only, email must have @)
- Job tab: Can only add customers already in database (the name must match database records)
- Relational Database linking (for future linking jobs with materials and calculating via API)
- Normalisation (3NF database)
